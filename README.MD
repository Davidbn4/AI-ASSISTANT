Key Changes:

Removed Placeholders:
The extract_city_from_input function now includes a simple (but not very robust) way to extract the city from the user's input.
The extract_alarm_time function similarly extracts the time.
These are just basic examples and should be improved for more reliable extraction.
Added Default Responses:
The responses dictionary now has actual responses instead of "placeholder" messages.
API Key Reminder:
There's a clear reminder to replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.
External Data File:
The main() function now calls learn_from_external_data("external_data.json"). You'll need to create this external_data.json file with your additional training data.
Important Notes:

Error Handling: While there's some basic error handling, this code is still not production-ready. You should add more robust error handling, especially for user input and API interactions.
Q-Learning: The Q-learning part is still very basic and needs to be expanded to be truly functional.
Data Extraction: The city and alarm time extraction methods are very simple and will likely not work well for all types of user input. You should improve these with more sophisticated techniques (e.g., using regular expressions, named entity recognition, or a dedicated time parsing library).
